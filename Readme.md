LoRA model trained with Khoya on Stable Diffusion 1.5. The purpose of this LoRA is to generate 16 by 16 pixel game assets.

## Usage
To test and generate images, use the Gradio Google Colab  
- Make sure to change your runtime type to a T4 GPU
- Run each code block in order and then utilize the generated Gradio link

**Prompting:**  
For best results, use a comma-separated prompt.  
Example: `diamond helmet, blue, weapon`

## Challenges/Limitations
- Due to the small size of the dataset, some items won't turn out well
- White items may not generate well due to training on white backgrounds
